## Running the app

This repository currently contains only TypeScript source modules in `src/` without an
application entry point, build configuration, or dependency manifest (e.g. `package.json`).
As a result, there is no runnable app or start command yet.

To make this runnable, you will need to add:

- A project scaffold (for example, React, React Native, or a web framework)
- A `package.json` with scripts (e.g. `dev`, `start`, `build`)
- An application entry point that renders the UI (e.g. `src/App.tsx`)
- Any required environment configuration (e.g. `.env` for API keys)

Once those are in place, run the appropriate script from your chosen framework (for example,
`npm run dev` or `npm start`).
